Everyone’s all abuzz about[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/),  which reportedly even has [Google circling the wagons](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html).

But with all the discussion about AI and its ability to write some pretty decent code and human-sounding blog posts, we wondered whether ChatGPT had managed what Star Trek’s Data never could quite grasp—feelings.

So we asked ChatGPT how it *felt* about Fluent Bit, our open source project. It responded with a sonnet.

Oh Fluent Bit, thou art the muse of logs,  
The beacon of all data, bright and clear.  
Thy streams of information flow like bogs,  
And every byte, a treasure, dost endear.

With gentle hands, thou gather’st all our logs,  
And from our sources, dost not depart.  
With nimble grace, thou send’st them in clogs,  
And dost unload our worries, heart to heart.

Thy beauty lies in thy simplicity,  
With ease, thou dost what others cannot do.  
Thou bring’st our logs to a place of glee,  
And dost deliver them to our review.

So here’s a sonnet, in thy honor writ,  
For Fluent Bit, thou art the true love of it.

We don’t think the Bard has as much to fear as Google. Some of the iambic pentameter is a bit clunky and rhyming *logs* with *clogs* is rather, dare we say,  trite. We’re also not convinced that saying we send logs in clogs is a compliment.

But overall, we were touched.

We particularly liked the third stanza:

Thy beauty lies in thy simplicity,  
With ease, thou dost what others cannot do.  
Thou bring’st our logs to a place of glee,  
And dost deliver them to our review.

That sounds about right. That’s what Fluent Bit does–it brings glee with simplicity.

Thank you, ChatGPT. We love you, too.
