##### A Long Term Support Version And Professional Services Plan For Enterprises Running Fluent Bit As Part Of Their IT Infrastructure.

**SAN FRANCISCO, May 16, 2022** – [Calyptia](https://calyptia.com) today announced the general availability of Calyptia for Fluent Bit, a long term support version and professional services plan for enterprises running Fluent Bit as part of their IT infrastructure. Calyptia Fluent Bit customers receive security updates, patches and bug fixes, and basic support for a defined period of time while running a standardized, security-hardened, stable version of Fluent Bit.

Calyptia is uniquely positioned to offer long term support for Fluent Bit users as it was co-founded by the creator of Fluent Bit and the company is the primary maintainer of the Fluent Bit project.

Fluent Bit is the industry-standard open-source engine for enterprise observability of logs and metrics, and it is included in major Kubernetes distributions, including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It collects and processes event data from any source and routes that data to any destination–even multiple destinations–for storage and analysis. It is the preferred choice for cloud and containerized environments and recently surpassed one billion deployments.

Fluent Bit is becoming increasingly mission critical in observability environments due to its high performance and lightweight footprint, allowing it to process petabytes of data a day while consuming few resources. Fluent Bit also takes a vendor-neutral approach to the systems with which it interacts, helping enterprises avoid costly vendor-lock solutions.

Open source software offers innovation, features and rapid speed; however, these same advantages become challenges to enterprises struggling to stay up to date. Calyptia Fluent Bit addresses these challenges by combining innovation with stability, support and hardened security for enterprises that require predictable upgrades and an SLA.

“We have had several companies approach us about enterprise offerings and support services,” said Eduardo Silva, Calyptia co-founder and creator of Fluent Bit, “so there is definitely a need. The more we thought about their requests we realized that Calyptia Fluent Bit is a logical expansion of our current and planned offerings. As organizations adopt distributed, dynamic, cloud-native services, the challenge is quickly and efficiently getting insights out of the mountain of log and event data created across the enterprise. Providing solutions to that challenge is what Calyptia does and Calyptia Fluent Bit is an ideal option for some organizations.”

Last month, Gartner, a leading technological research and consulting firm, named Calyptia a “[Cool Vendor](https://calyptia.com/blog/calyptia-named-a-cool-vendor-by-gartner)” for monitoring and observability solutions, a rapidly growing sector that prompted Gartner analysts to write that “this trend may lead to the 2020s being known as ‘the decade of observability.’”
