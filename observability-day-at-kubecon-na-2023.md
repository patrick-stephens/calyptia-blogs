*This post was [originally published on the Calyptia blog](https://calyptia.com/blog/observability-day-at-kubecon-na-2023). [Calyptia](https://calyptia.com) is the primary sponsor and creator of the Fluent Bit project.*

Calyptia, the creator and primary maintainer of Fluent Bit, is proud to sponsor [Observability Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/observability-day/), a co-located event during [Kubecon + CloudNativeCon North America 2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) to be held on November 6, 2023, in Chicago, IL. 

Observability Day fosters collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing of cloud-native observability projects (including but not necessarily limited to Prometheus, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, OpenTelemetry, and OpenMetrics), as well as vendor-neutral best practices for addressing observability challenges.

With over [8 billion downloads](https://twitter.com/CalyptiaInc/status/1674803641868337152), Fluent Bit is a key component of observability programs around the world. 

As a co-located event, Observability Day occurs on the first day of Kubecon + CloudNativeCon North America, which runs November 6-9.

Calyptia helped to organize the inaugural Observability Day (originally called Open Observability Day) at last year’s Kubecon + CloudNativeCon North America in Detroit. That event evolved from previous FluentCon co-located events, which focused specifically on the Fluent Bit and Fluentd projects.

## Present at Observability Day

Share your knowledge and experiences with the community. The [call for proposals](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/cfp-colocated-events/) is open through August 6, 2023.

## Meet Calyptia and the Fluent Bit Maintainers
