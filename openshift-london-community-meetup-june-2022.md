I was invited to the Red Hat offices in London near Monument to present at the [OpenShift Community Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-OpenShift-User-Group/events/285871848/) on some of my highlights from the recent FluentCon and KubeCon conferences in Valencia.

I went through what I thought were my personal highlights along with some other bits and pieces from the conference.

Here’s my presentation.

If short of time, my personal highlights were the following:

* [Reproducing Production Issues in your CI Pipeline Using eBPF](https://youtu.be/_RQLY4KXXG8) — Matthew LeRay & Omid Azizi
* [Make the Secure Kubernetes Supply Chain Work for You](https://youtu.be/ffiaA__8UAE) — Adolfo García Veytia, Chainguard

The other recommendation is the various Fluent ecosystem workshops we now have running in [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com/) sandboxes: <https://info.calyptia.com/learning-labs>

It is worth popping along to a meetup in the future, if only for the cheese and wine!

Next week I will also be popping along to the OpenShift Commons London event so it will be good to see folks there.
