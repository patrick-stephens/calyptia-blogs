Today, air travel is a common mode of transportation for business and leisure. While the aircraft itself is an impressive technological feat, the aviation industry depends heavily on software systems to ensure safe and secure flight operations. These systems are used for flight planning, scheduling, and passenger check-in, generating and tracking essential metrics.

Given the multitude of software applications and systems used in the aviation industry, it is crucial to collect and analyze the vast amount of data they generate. This allows airlines to swiftly identify and resolve issues that could potentially impact the availability and reliability of their applications and systems, ensuring safe and efficient flight operations

In this blog post, we will explore the importance of metrics in the aviation industry and beyond. Metrics play a critical role in monitoring the performance of software systems, allowing organizations to quickly detect and address issues that could impact their operations

## What are Metrics?

One of the three pillars of software observability is Metrics, with logs and traces being the other two. Metrics are quantitative measurements of a system’s performance, behavior, and usage. By monitoring metrics over time, developers and administrators can detect anomalies, identify trends and provide insights into the health and behavior of a system. Metrics help organizations make data-driven decisions about their applications and infrastructure.

There are numerous metrics that a system can emit and one can collect; however, here are some of the common performance metrics that one can come across:

* **Response time:**The time a system takes to respond to a user request. This metric is important because it directly impacts the user experience. For example, a slow response time on a website or application can frustrate users and drive them away.
* **Error rate:**The percentage of requests that result in errors or failures. This metric is important for identifying issues and measuring the reliability of a software system. For example, a high error rate on a mobile application could indicate that there are bugs in the code or that the application is not handling user inputs correctly.
* **Latency:**The time required for a request to travel from the user to the system and back. This metric is important because it affects the overall performance of a software system. For example, high latency in a video conferencing application could result in a delay in audio or video, making it difficult for users to communicate effectively.
* **Throughput:** The number of requests a system can handle per unit of time. This metric is important for measuring the capacity and scalability of a system. For example, a high-throughput messaging application could handle thousands of messages per second, allowing it to support a large number of users.
* **Resource utilization:**The percentage of a system’s resources—such as CPU, memory, or disk—that are being used. This metric is important for identifying performance bottlenecks and ensuring a system has enough resources to handle its workload. For example, high resource utilization on a database server could indicate that it is underpowered or that it is being overloaded with requests.

Having understood some of the common metrics, let us see why tracking and analyzing these metrics are important.

## Why do Metrics matter?

### Monitor the system’s health and performance

It is critical to monitor the health and performance of a system to ensure it is running smoothly and providing a good user experience. By collecting and analyzing metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization, developers and administrators can easily and quickly find issues affecting the system’s availability. This helps them take proactive steps to address issues before they result in downtime and affect the user experience. 

### Detect patterns and trends in behavior

When collecting data over time, it’s critical to identify patterns and trends as that helps understand the system’s behavior. By tracking metrics over time, teams can detect changes in behavior that may point to an underlying issue. For instance, if the error rate of a web application is increasing over time, then it’s an indication of a growing issue that needs immediate attention. 

### Establish performance benchmarks and goals

A key goal of continuous improvement is ensuring the quality of your application improves over time. Setting performance benchmarks help ingrain a culture of continuous improvement. Establishing specific targets for metrics can help organizations measure their progress toward delivering a good product and  experience to their customers. For example, setting a target error rate of less than 1% will enable the team to constantly deliver a better quality experience to the users. 

### Gain valuable insights for decision-making

While collecting and storing metrics is important, analyzing them is critical. Analyzing metrics can give insights that can lead to informed decision-making across a range of areas. Metrics related to user engagement, retention, and satisfaction can help the team make informed decisions to build product and device marketing strategies. Metrics related to system performance and reliability can help make better decisions when it comes to infrastructure investment and management.

### Track the impact of new features and changes

New features and changes can lead to unforeseen situations. Hence tracking the impact of such feature changes is critical for ensuring that they are delivering the intended benefits and not causing any issues. By tracking such metrics before and after the release of a feature, an organization can learn about the impact of the feature on key performance indicators and user experience. This also helps in continuous improvement and meeting customer expectations. 

## Building a Metrics-Driven Culture

Metrics are critical to understanding the health and performance of systems by identifying trends and patterns to help teams make informed decisions. However, collecting metrics is just one part of the puzzle. In order to truly improve the quality of software and services, organizations must build a metrics-driven culture. This means prioritizing the collection, analysis, and use of metrics at every level of the organization, from development to operations. The culture needs to be ingrained within the organization in a way that at every step quality and metrics are considered.

### How to Establish a Metric-Driven Culture

Having a clear objective defining the metrics aligned with your business objective is essential for success. The metrics should be measurable and easily accessible. Once you have defined a metric-based goal—say error rate of 1%—this needs to be communicated to all the teams along with its importance and relevance to business outcomes. This can be done through meetings, workshops, and training sessions.

Below are a few tips on how you can cultivate and promote metrics across the organization:

* **Set clear goals and expectations**: Define the key metrics that matter to your business and communicate them clearly to all teams and departments.
* **Make metrics accessible and visible**: Ensure that metrics are easily accessible to all stakeholders and are displayed in a visually understandable manner.
* **Encourage collaboration**: Foster a culture of collaboration where teams work together to improve metrics and share best practices.
* **Provide training and support**: Offer training and support to help teams understand how to use metrics effectively and make data-driven decisions.
* **Recognize and reward success**: Recognize and reward teams that achieve their metrics goals and celebrate successes across the organization.

Building a metrics-driven culture is crucial for ensuring that an organization is on the path to continuous improvement. By establishing a shared understanding of what metrics are important and how they are used, teams can work together to identify areas for improvement and measure progress.

Lastly, it is important to regularly review and update the metrics based on feedback and changing business requirements. Building a metrics-driven culture takes time and effort, but can provide valuable insights and improve overall business performance in the long run.

## Summary

Metrics matter as they provide vital insights into the performance and health of systems and applications. Through observability and monitoring, teams can gather relevant data to identify and troubleshoot issues, ultimately leading to improved quality and user experience. 

Building a metrics-driven culture is crucial for organizations to fully leverage the benefits of metrics, with strategies such as establishing clear metrics goals and promoting cross-team collaboration. By prioritizing metrics, organizations can better understand their systems and applications, make data-driven decisions, and ultimately drive business success.
