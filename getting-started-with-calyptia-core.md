In this video, Calyptia Co-Founder and VP of Product Anurag Gupta demonstrates how to get started with [Calyptia Core](https://calyptia.com/products/calyptia-core) — our low-code telemetry pipeline.

Gupta first provides a quick overview of Core before walking you through an installation of Core on an AWS EC2 instance. He then demonstrates how to use the Core UI to create an auto-healing, auto-scaling telemetry pipeline to send collected data to OpenSearch.

All in about five minutes!
