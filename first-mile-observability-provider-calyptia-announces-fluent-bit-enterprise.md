### Streamline observability pipelines, reduce data costs, and easily add data backends with the first-mile data aggregation solution, from the creators of Fluentd and Fluent Bit

**December 07, 2021 11:00 ET**

San Francisco, CA, Dec. 07, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — First-mile observability provider Calyptia today announced a private beta release of [Calyptia Enterprise for Fluent Bit](https://calyptia.com/), a hyper-performant enterprise version of Fluent Bit for aggregating, filtering and managing observability pipelines composed of multiple backends and destinations, at petabytes of scale. With a commitment to helping customers focus on gaining the most insight and value out of their data pipelines and understanding how data is flowing in the first mile of observability, Calyptia Enterprise for Fluent Bit will support cloud native environments, including on-premises and cloud-based Kubernetes.

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/ "Fluent Bit")is an open source logging and metrics processor for collecting observability data from different sources. It is deployed millions of times every day in cloud and containerized environments including by Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and other cloud service providers, and is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project Calyptia was founded by the creators and maintainers of Fluentd and Fluent Bit, a vendor-neutral hosted solution for visualizing and optimizing observability pipelines. Calyptia Enterprise for Fluent Bit brings greater scalability and control over observability pipelines.

“We’ve seen a typical growth pattern among cloud native organizations in which they may start with one use case and one data backend, but start to experience pain with data costs and observability at scale,” said Anurag Gupta, Calyptia. “Eventually, an organization might have so many workloads, use cases and backends, that they struggle in collecting and routing that data to the correct destinations. We created Calyptia Enterprise for Fluent Bit for simplicity at enterprise scale for the best Fluent Bit experience yet.”

Calyptia Enterprise for Fluent Bit delivers streamlined observability, no matter how much data load or logs are running through an environment. With a single command, customers can deploy, manage, and scale performance instantly. Further features and benefits include:

* Reduce costs and keep the edge lightweight with first mile data aggregation, filtering, processing, and auto-healing.
* Route, experiment, and add  backends such as Prometheus, Datadog, S3 and Kafka with ease and no disruption to your production workloads.
* Manage and automate via CLI to control scaling, deployment, and rollback across multiple instances
* Run with confidence with integrations for  Secrets, Certificates, and custom Port Mapping. All data stays in your secure environment.

Calyptia Enterprise for Fluent Bit is now available in private beta.
