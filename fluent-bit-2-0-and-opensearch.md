Calyptia co-founder Anurag Gupta recently guest-authored a piece for the OpenSearch blog on “[Fluent Bit 2.0 and OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/fluentbit20-and-opensearch/).” In it, he discusses some of the features of Fluent Bit v2.0 and how to use them to get started with OpenSearch.

[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is a scalable, flexible, and extensible open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications that is maintained by Amazon Web Services.

In early 2022, Calyptia [partnered with the OpenSearch project team](https://calyptia.com/blog/calyptia-and-opensearch-partner-to-build-first-party-connectors-to-fluent-bit-and-fluentd) to bring first-party connectors for OpenSearch to Fluent Bit and Fluentd.
