*This post was [originally published on the Calyptia blog](https://calyptia.com/blog/calyptia-for-fluent-bit-is-on-aws-marketplace). [Calyptia](https://calyptia.com) is the primary sponsor and creator of the Fluent Bit project.*

We are happy to announce that Calyptia for Fluent Bit is [now available in the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-z2en74bwhkfug).

Calyptia Fluent Bit is our long-term support (LTS) version of Fluent Bit, the industry-standard open-source engine for enterprise observability of logs, metrics, and traces. Calyptia Fluent Bit is used by organizations that love the power and flexibility of Fluent Bit in their observability efforts but who need additional stability and support. Calyptia Fluent Bit provides them with a stable, security-hardened, production-proven version of open source Fluent Bit. It also comes with the technical expertise of the Calyptia team, handling all the security updates, patches, and bug fixes while generally ensuring that everything runs smoothly.Â 

Having Calyptia Fluent Bit available in AWS Marketplace means it is easier than ever for AWS customers to get started with Calyptia for Fluent Bit. Just click, buy, and get started with a containerized version of Fluent Bit. Because billing is handled through AWS it can also simplify procurement for some enterprises.

And we are all about having options, which is why we make sure that Fluent Bit is vendor-neutral and integrates smoothly with every possible backend that our customers might use.Â 

We are also really excited about being in AWS Marketplace because it is yet another connection in our ongoing relationship with AWS. About two years ago, Fluent Bit became [the default log forwarder in Cloudwatch Container Insights](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/fluent-bit-integration-in-cloudwatch-container-insights-for-eks/), meaning that thousands of AWS customers already use Fluent Bit as part of their observability pipeline (even if they donâ€™t realize it).

And then, earlier this year, we announced [a partnership with the OpenSearch team at AWS](https://calyptia.com/blog/calyptia-and-opensearch-partner-to-build-first-party-connectors-to-fluent-bit-and-fluentd) to bring first-party connectors for OpenSearch to Fluent Bit and Fluentd. The OpenSearch team wanted to make sure that their users have a reliable and straightforward way to ingest data to OpenSearch from almost any data source, and they thought Fluent Bit was the best way to go (as did we!).

If you havenâ€™t yet tried Fluent Bit, or if the Marketplace isnâ€™t the best option for you, weâ€™d be happy to chat with you about other ways to purchase Calyptia Fluent Bit or any of [our other products](https://calyptia.com/products/calyptia-core) (remember, we love options). Just [reach out to us](https://calyptia.com/contact).
