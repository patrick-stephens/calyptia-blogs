In a recently released report, analyst firm Gartner® cited [Calyptia Core](https://calyptia.com/products/calyptia-core) as an example of a telemetry pipeline product, a sector that the firm expects to see grow in the coming years:


> By 2026, 40% of log telemetry will be processed through a telemetry pipeline product, up from less than 10% in 2022.

Earlier this year, Gartner named Calyptia a [Cool Vendor in Observability and Monitoring for Logging and Containers](https://calyptia.com/blog/calyptia-named-a-cool-vendor-by-gartner).

## Three Key Challenges for Observability Programs

Some of the biggest challenges facing enterprises regarding Observability are

* the exponential growth of telemetry data
* the complexity of the data pipelines
* the cost of storage and analyzing all that data.

Large-scale, cloud-native architectures can easily generate terabytes, even petabytes, of logs daily. The numbers and ephemeral nature of those servers make it extremely difficult to manage the collection and delivery of their telemetry data.

A simple misconfiguration could easily send terabytes of useless data to very expensive storage and analysis systems, costing thousands of dollars before the mistake is discovered and corrected. Or even worse, relevant data could be misdirected or dropped entirely causing delays in identifying and troubleshooting problems, and ultimately undermining the Observability program as a whole.

## Gartner Recommendations

For organizations facing the challenges of operationalizing their observability strategy, Gartner recommends the following:


> Adopt telemetry pipeline products that support both operational and security use cases across the enterprise. Invest in a telemetry pipeline product that allows you to collect data once, transform and filter it and direct it to any tools that fits your needs.Invest in telemetry pipeline tools that can manage long-term data retention requirements in a cost-effective way and also support recovery of data for analysis and forensic purposes.Develop observability strategies that can scale to meet the ever-growing volume of telemetry data and adopt structured logging mechanisms

In our humble opinion, Calyptia Core can help organizations with all of the above.

## Calyptia Core as a Solution

Calyptia Core’s plug-and-play approach to configuring data sources and destinations enables I&O teams to quickly and easily aggregate observability data at scale and ensures that all data is captured, processed, and routed as desired, regardless of its source or destination.

Calyptia Core provides the ability to process your data while in-stream. This allows you to perform specific record modifications like append or remove a key, enrich with specific metadata (e.g: Kubernetes Filter), or route records based on specific conditions, empowering you to make sound business decisions that could result in substantial savings.

Under the hood of Calyptia Core is Fluent Bit, the leading open source log processor and forwarder with [over three billion downloads and deployments](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/10/13/fluent-bit-surpasses-three-billion-downloads/). Fluent Bit has proven its ability to handle petabytes of data daily in production environments, so you can be confident that as your volume of telemetry data grows that Fluent Bit and Calyptia Core can scale with you.
