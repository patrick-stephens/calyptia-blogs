When Anurag and I started Calyptia we had a simple goal — innovate in the area of the  Observability space that many had largely ignored — collection. We were no strangers to this problem having built the open source Fluent projects over the past decade to help users collect data from servers, containers, embedded systems, and more to route to analytic platforms for business value. 

I would have never dreamed that those first few commits for Fluent Bit in 2014 would become a strong community of 10,000+ Fluent users, 12 billion Docker deployments, and a default in all major public cloud providers.

With Calyptia we were able to build on this community, allowing us to strengthen our commitment to these projects while building an enterprise offering granting organizations more control of their observability data. We are proud to call some of the largest banks, financial institutions, and organizations among our customers.

When taking the next step for Calyptia we always wanted to keep the commitment to open source while providing real value for our customers and users.

We were lucky to find fellow like-minded entrepreneurs and open source creators — Martin Mao and Rob Skillington from Chronosphere. From building M3 at Uber and managing the team that launched Jaeger to their contributions to Prometheus and OTel, we were blown away by the Chronosphere platform for logs, metrics, traces, and events — and how it committed firmly to the idea of providing value on top of open standards.

Today we are excited to announce that Calyptia is now part of Chronosphere. This will bring new benefits and opportunities to both Calyptia and Chronosphere customers while we continue to provide a vendor neutral approach to control observability data to any backend. Chronosphere allows organizations to completely control their observability data and costs, all while fixing issues faster and wrangling cloud native complexity. With Calyptia, telemetry can be automatically routed to a best-in-class observability solution (such as Chronosphere) for monitoring, to a SIEM platform that helps  maintain your security posture, and to integrate disparate systems in cloud native environments.

As part of Chronosphere, we look forward to continuing to do what we’ve always done, keep innovating and building alongside the Fluent community.
