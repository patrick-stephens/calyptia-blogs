*This post was [originally published on the Calyptia blog](https://calyptia.com/blog/observability-day-at-kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2023). [Calyptia](https://calyptia.com) is the primary sponsor and creator of the Fluent Bit project.*

Calyptia is a proud Diamond-level sponsor of [Observability Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/cncf-hosted-co-located-events/observability-day/), a co-located event during Kubecon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023 to be held on April 18, 2023, in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Observability Day fosters collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing of cloud-native observability projects (including but not necessarily limited to Prometheus, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, OpenTelemetry, and OpenMetrics), as well as vendor-neutral best practices for addressing observability challenges.

“We are excited to once again be sponsoring Observability Day,” said Calyptia CEO and co-founder Eduardo Silva. “Observability has proven itself to be highly beneficial to DevOps teams, and open source communities are driving its advancement. Observability Day provides a great way for practitioners, contributors, and maintainers to learn from each other. As maintainers of Fluent Bit and Fluentd, it is important for us to collaborate with other CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) projects related to observability as well as the industry practitioners using our products.”

As a co-located event, Observability Day occurs on the first day of Kubecon + CloudNativeCon Europe, which runs the week of April 18-21.

Calyptia helped to organize the inaugural Observability Day (originally called Open Observability Day) at last year’s Kubecon + CloudNativeCon North America in Detroit which was attended by over 150 people. That event evolved from previous FluentCon gatherings, which focused only on the Fluent Bit and Fluentd projects.
