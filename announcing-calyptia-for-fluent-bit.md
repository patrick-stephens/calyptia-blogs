I’m writing this from my hotel room in Valencia, Spain, where tomorrow morning I will be making the opening remarks for FluentCon Europe, a co-located event of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022. I’m looking forward to spending the day learning, sharing, and talking with fellow Fluent enthusiasts.

It’s been thrilling to have been a part of the growth of Fluentd and Fluent Bit. In March, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) announced that Fluent Bit had surpassed the momentous milestone of having been [downloaded and deployed over one billion times](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/22/fluent-bit-reaches-1-billion-downloads/). It surely owes much of its success to the vendor-neutral approach to the systems with which it interacts, helping enterprises avoid costly vendor-lock solutions. It has become the industry-standard open-source engine for enterprise observability of logs and metrics and is mission-critical in many enterprises.

That is why we have decided to release Calyptia for Fluent Bit, a long-term support version and professional services plan for enterprises running Fluent Bit as part of their IT infrastructure. Calyptia Fluent Bit customers receive security updates, patches and bug fixes, and basic support for a defined period of time while running a standardized, security-hardened, stable version of Fluent Bit.

We have had several companies approach us about enterprise offerings and support services, so there is definitely a need. The more we thought about their requests we realized that Calyptia Fluent Bit is a logical expansion of our current and planned offerings. As organizations adopt distributed, dynamic, cloud-native services, the challenge is how to quickly and efficiently get insights out of the mountain of log and event data created across the enterprise. Providing solutions to that challenge is what Calyptia does and Calypia Fluent Bit is an ideal option for some organizations.

If you would like to learn more about Calyptia Fluent Bit check out our website. Or, if you are attending KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 stop by the Calyptia booth–we’d love to chat with you and we might even have some cool swag to give away.
